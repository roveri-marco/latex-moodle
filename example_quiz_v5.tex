\begin{tablenotes}
\item[1] Numbering with option ``ABC" is not recognized by moodle after XML 
import.
\item[2] \LaTeX{} code here tends to break the compilation of the document. 
Probably because of the symbol $\backslash$ or $\{$.
\item[3] Moodle uses a dropdown list to let the user choose among the 
possible answers. This forbids either pictures and \LaTeX{} rendering.
\item[4] Not supported by moodle (in this context, answer-specific feedback 
represents lots of possible combinations).
\item[5] Moodle uses a HMTL input tag to let the user enter his answer. This 
forbids pictures and \LaTeX{} rendering.
\item[6] In the context of this package, answers represent ``notes for the 
grader" while ``template" represents suggested contents as a starting point.
\item[7] For obvious reasons, essays cannot be graded automatically.
\item[8] The keyval ``response template", as documented, is broken. Works if 
replaced with ``template".
\item[9] Picture and LaTeX rendering could be done, but only after submission 
and only if the keyval "response format" was set to ``html". Unfortunately, the 
\texttt{<p>...</p>} tags introduced, whatever the response format is, prevent 
rendering.

\begin{matching}{Matching (standard)}
Answer-specific feedback is too complicated for matching questions (lots of 
possible combinations). Moodle does not support that\dots

In moodle, the matching is made by selecting answers in a dropdown list. The 
latter only allows text: pictures cannot be placed and neither HTML nor LaTeX 
are rendered. 
	\item[feedback={this feedback is garbage: it is placed in the XML but won't 
	make it through the moodle import}] Orange \answer Orange
	\item[feedback={Actually, moodle's matching question type does not seem to 
	support feedback}] $Lemon\quad\myequation$ \answer Yellow
	\item[feedback={sadly...}] Banana \answer Yellow
% "Yellow" is repeated twice but will appear only once in the offered answers
	\item[] Strawberry \answer Red
	\item[]  \answer Black
\end{matching}

\begin{matching}[dd]{Matching (drag and drop)}
This question type comes with a specific moodle plugin. In the offered answers, 
it allows to place pictures and get HTML or LaTeX 
rendered.\pictembedding{$\myequation$}
	\item[feedback={this feedback is garbage: it is placed in the XML but won't 
	make it through the moodle import}] 
	Orange \answer $Orange$
	\item[feedback={Actually, moodle's matching question type does not seem to 
	support feedback}] $Lemon\quad\myequation$ \answer Yellow
	\item[feedback={sadly...}] Banana \answer Yellow
% "Yellow" is repeated twice but will appear only once in the offered answers
	\item[] Strawberry \answer Red
	\item[]  \answer Black $\myequation$
\end{matching}

\begin{essay}[response required,response 
format=text,template={test $\myequation$}]{Essay}
Is learning worth it?
\item if the answer is "yes" $\rightarrow$ full grade
\item if the answer is silly  $\rightarrow$ minimum grade
\end{essay}

\begin{cloze}{Cloze}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->] (-1.5,0)--(1.5,0);
\draw[->] (0,-1.5)--(0,1.5);
\draw[fill=red,fill opacity=.2,draw=green] (0,0)circle[radius=1];
\node[text width=3.5cm,anchor=west] at (2.5,0) {This is a picture test. 
$\myequation$};
\end{tikzpicture}
Within the cloze environment, when using multichoice, moodle allows to make 
only one choice. Therefore, multiple choice questions shall be made such that 
all points can be acquired with a single good answer only. A limitation of 
moodle's parser, discussed 
\href{https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=275299}{here}, has to be 
overcome for math display in answers or feedbacks that contain closing curly 
braces ($\}$). It should be escaped with a $\backslash$.

\begin{multi}
First, an inline dropdown list. It is very compact on moodle. The drawback is 
that there is no LaTeX or HTML rendering in answers. The feedback renders HMTL 
and LaTeX. It is a bit hidden as it pops up only when hovering the 
checkmark or X mark with the mouse.
\item[feedback={yes}]* chip
\item[fraction=10] chop
\item[feedback={this is a quite long feedback.}] chap
\end{multi}

\begin{multi}[horizontal]
Second, an horizontal multichoice. May be quite compact as well but inadequate 
when possible answers are lengthy or numerous. Both answers and feedback can 
be rendered using LaTeX and HTML.
\item[feedback={text}]* True
\item[] False
\item[feedback={silly!}] $Dunno$
\end{multi}

\begin{multi}[vertical]
Last, a vertical multichoice. Behaves like the standard single multichoice.
\item[feedback={yes!}]* yop
\item[fraction=20] yap
\item[feedback={no!}] yip
\item[feedback={nope...}] $yup$
\end{multi}
\end{cloze}
